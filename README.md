### ðŸ“Š Telecom Customer Churn Analysis (Python â€“ Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

In this project, I performed a comprehensive exploratory data analysis on a telecom customer dataset containing 7,043 records. The goal was to understand customer behavior and identify factors contributing to churn. Key steps and insights include:

* **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and converted data types, specifically transforming blank `TotalCharges` values to 0 and converting `SeniorCitizen` from numeric (0/1) to categorical (`Yes/No`) for better readability.
* **Data Exploration**:

  * Used count plots, histograms, and pie charts to visualize churn distribution across various demographics and services.
  * Identified patterns in churn across gender, tenure, senior citizens, and service usage.
* **Visualization Highlights**:

  * Visual comparison of churn rates across contract types, payment methods, and service categories.
  * Tenure distribution revealed higher churn among customers with shorter tenure periods.
* **Tools Used**: `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `NumPy`

This analysis provides actionable insights into customer retention strategies, emphasizing the importance of service quality and long-term contracts.
